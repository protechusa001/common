<b>Return Policy â€“ PROTECH</b>
Before Returning a Product:
 Please contact PROTECH to obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) before sending any packages back.
Return Shipping Responsibility:
 The buyer is responsible for returning the product(s) to PROTECH. Upon request, PROTECH will provide a return shipping quote, which the buyer must accept or decline in writing before proceeding.
Return Shipping Label Policy:
Each return shipping label is valid for only one original package that was shipped to you.


We only accept returns in the original packaging provided by PROTECH.


Do not tape multiple boxes together or attempt to return multiple packages using a single label. Doing so may result in significant carrier fees, which are the responsibility of the buyer.


Shipping Instructions:
 Once you receive the return shipping label:
Print and securely attach it to the package.


Cover all old labels or barcodes using paper or a black marker.


Drop off the package at your nearest UPS or FedEx location (as instructed).


After we receive the return and confirm that the item is in its original condition, we will issue a refund within a few business days.

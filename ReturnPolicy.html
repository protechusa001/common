  <h1>Return Policy – PROTECH</h1>

  <h2>Before Returning a Product</h2>
  <p>
    Please contact PROTECH to obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) before sending any packages back.
  </p>

  <h2>Return Shipping Responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    The buyer is responsible for returning the product(s) to PROTECH. Upon request, PROTECH will provide a return shipping quote, which the buyer must accept or decline in writing before proceeding.
  </p>

  <h2>Return Shipping Label Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Each return shipping label is valid for only one original package that was shipped to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    We only accept returns in the original packaging provided by PROTECH.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not tape multiple boxes together or attempt to return multiple packages using a single label. Doing so may result in significant carrier fees, which are the responsibility of the buyer.
  </p>

  <h2>Shipping Instructions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Once you receive the return shipping label, print and securely attach it to the package.</li>
    <li>Cover all old labels or barcodes using paper or a black marker.</li>
    <li>Drop off the package at your nearest UPS or FedEx location (as instructed).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After we receive the return and confirm that the item is in its original condition, we will issue a refund within a few business days.
